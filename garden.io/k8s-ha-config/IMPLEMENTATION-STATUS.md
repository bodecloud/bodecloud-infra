# HA Kubernetes Cluster Implementation Status

## Reality check

This file is one of the useful corrective anchors in the branch because it
still shows that deployment work remained in progress.
It should be read as an implementation-progress artifact, not as evidence that
the Kubernetes path already replaced the root Compose-first runtime.

For the broader evidence-led reading, see:

## Current Status: historical branch progress snapshot

### ✅ Completed

1. **Node Preparation**
   - All 5 nodes accessible via SSH
   - Node preparation scripts created
   - Kernel parameters configured
   - Network prerequisites set up

2. **Configuration Files Created**
   - kubeadm HA configuration with 3-node control plane
   - etcd cluster configuration (3-node)
   - Calico CNI HA setup
   - Longhorn distributed storage configuration
   - HA service templates
   - Pod disruption budgets
   - Anti-affinity rules

3. **Garden.io Integration**
   - HA provider configuration
   - Service deployment templates
   - HA deployment scripts

### 🔄 In Progress

1. **Kubernetes Installation**
   - Fixing GPG key issues
   - Installing kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl on all nodes

2. **Cluster Initialization**
   - Setting up primary control plane
   - Configuring etcd cluster
   - Joining additional nodes

### 📋 Next Steps

1. **Complete Kubernetes Installation**
   ```bash
   ./garden.io/k8s-ha-config/fix-k8s-install.sh
   ```

2. **Initialize Primary Control Plane**
   ```bash
   ssh micklethefickle.bolabaden.org
   sudo kubeadm init --config=/tmp/kubeadm-production-config.yaml
   ```

3. **Join Additional Control Plane Nodes**
   ```bash
   # On cloudserver1 and cloudserver2
   sudo kubeadm join --control-plane ...
   ```

4. **Join Worker Nodes**
   ```bash
   # On cloudserver3 and blackboar
   sudo kubeadm join ...
   ```

5. **Install CNI (Calico)**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f garden.io/k8s-ha-config/calico-ha.yaml
   ```

6. **Install Storage (Longhorn)**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f garden.io/k8s-ha-config/longhorn-ha.yaml
   ```

7. **Deploy Services with HA**
   ```bash
   ./garden.io/k8s-ha-config/deploy-all-ha-services.sh
   ```

## Zero SPOF Architecture

### Control Plane (3 nodes)
- etcd: 3-node cluster (can lose 1)
- kube-apiserver: 3 instances with load balancer
- kube-scheduler: 3 instances with leader election
- kube-controller-manager: 3 instances with leader election

### Worker Nodes (2 nodes)
- All pods distributed across nodes
- Anti-affinity ensures no single node failure

### Storage
- Longhorn with replication factor 3
- Data replicated across nodes
- Automatic failover

### Services
- Minimum 3 replicas per service
- Pod disruption budgets
- Anti-affinity rules
- Health checks

## Verification

Once deployed, verify with:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide
kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces
kubectl get pv
kubectl get storageclass
```

## Failover Testing

Test scenarios:
1. Drain a control plane node → Cluster continues
2. Drain a worker node → Pods reschedule
3. Stop etcd on one node → Cluster maintains quorum
4. Stop storage node → Data available on replicas

The branch considered these configurations ready for later deployment work.
That should not be mistaken for proof that the cluster path is finished.
