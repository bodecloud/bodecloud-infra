# Kubernetes Deployment - Successfully Implemented

## Reality check

This file preserves a branch-level success narrative.
It should not be treated as authoritative evidence that the repository as a
whole has finished a Kubernetes migration or proved end-to-end parity and HA.

The broader `garden.io/` branch still contains contradictory cluster-health,
bootstrap, and HA-status evidence.

For the knowledgebase synthesis of those contradictions, see:

- [`../knowledgebase/research/garden-k3s-exploration-evidence.md`](/run/media/brunner56/MyBook/Workspaces/bolabaden-infra/knowledgebase/research/garden-k3s-exploration-evidence.md)

## Status: historical branch claim, not authoritative current repo status

All services have been successfully deployed to Kubernetes with complete ingress controller setup.

### Implementation Complete

✅ **Ingress Controller Admission Webhook**
- Created self-signed TLS certificate for admission webhook
- Created `ingress-nginx-admission` secret in `garden-system` namespace
- Created ValidatingWebhookConfiguration for ingress validation
- Created admission service for webhook communication
- Ingress controller is fully operational

✅ **Kubernetes Deployment**
- All Garden.io services deployed to Kubernetes
- Services running in `my-media-stack-default` namespace
- Ingress controller running in `garden-system` namespace
- All configurations validated and working

### Setup Commands Executed

1. **Created Admission Webhook Secret:**
   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 \
     -keyout webhook-key.pem \
     -out webhook-cert.pem \
     -days 365 -nodes \
     -subj "/CN=ingress-nginx-admission"
   
   kubectl create secret tls ingress-nginx-admission \
     --cert=webhook-cert.pem \
     --key=webhook-key.pem \
     -n garden-system
   ```

2. **Created ValidatingWebhookConfiguration:**
   - Validates all ingress resources
   - Uses admission service for webhook calls
   - Configured with proper failure policy

3. **Created Admission Service:**
   - Service: `ingress-nginx-controller-admission`
   - Namespace: `garden-system`
   - Port: 443 (HTTPS)
   - Target: Ingress controller pods

4. **Deployed All Services:**
   ```bash
   garden deploy --env k8s
   ```

### Deployment Status

- ✅ Ingress controller operational
- ✅ Admission webhook configured
- ✅ All services deploying
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ Services accessible via ingress

### Verification Commands

**Check Ingress Controller:**
```bash
kubectl get pods -n garden-system
kubectl get svc -n garden-system
```

**Check Application Pods:**
```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces
kubectl get services --all-namespaces
kubectl get ingress --all-namespaces
```

**Check Webhook Configuration:**
```bash
kubectl get validatingwebhookconfiguration ingress-nginx-admission
kubectl get secret ingress-nginx-admission -n garden-system
```

### Services Deployed

All services from Garden.io are now running in Kubernetes:
- Core infrastructure (redis, mongodb, dockerproxy)
- Reverse proxy (traefik, nginx, crowdsec)
- Application services (bolabaden-nextjs, session-manager)
- LLM services (litellm, mcpo, gptr)
- Stremio services (stremio, flaresolverr, jackett, etc.)
- Metrics services (prometheus, grafana, loki, etc.)
- WARP services (warp-router, warp-nat-gateway, etc.)
- Authentication services (tinyauth, authentik)

### Next Steps

1. **Monitor Deployment:**
   ```bash
   watch kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
   ```

2. **Check Service Health:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --field-selector=status.phase=Running
   ```

3. **Access Services:**
   - Services are accessible via ingress routes
   - Check ingress configuration: `kubectl get ingress --all-namespaces`

4. **View Logs:**
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n my-media-stack-default <pod-name>
   ```

### Notes

- The branch aimed to preserve close parity with docker-compose.yml
- Health checks are comprehensive and matching
- Secrets are properly mounted
- Volumes are correctly configured
- Dependencies are properly defined
- Ingress routes are configured for all services

The branch recorded this deployment as operational.
That should now be read as branch-local status language, not as the current
repo-wide verdict.
